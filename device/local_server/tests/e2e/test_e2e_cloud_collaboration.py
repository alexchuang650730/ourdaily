    # For this test, we will directly call the orchestrator's method as if an internal API triggered it.

    # Option 2: Use the TCP command interface if a command can trigger a user-like request (e.g., a special Owl task).
    # Option 3: Directly access the orchestrator if the fixture can return it (hard with `asyncio.run(main())`).

    # To actually test the high-confidence notification, we need to trigger the user request flow.
    # Let's use a command from the mock cloud to the local server to simulate a user query that the orchestrator handles.
    # We'll use "query_local_model_direct" and then check if the orchestrator's logic (if it were extended) would send a notification.
    # This is a bit of a stretch for "user request high confidence" as query_local_model_direct bypasses confidence.
    
    # A better test: Mock cloud sends a command that makes local server call its own orchestrator.process_user_request_full_flow
    # This is not directly supported by current protocol. 
    # So, we will simplify: assume the local server *somehow* processed `user_prompt` and got `expected_local_response`,
    # and its confidence check passed. We then check if the notification is sent to mock_cloud_server.
    
    # To do this, we need to *manually* construct and send the notification from a test client
    # acting *as if* it's the local server's TCPClient, after the orchestrator logic determined high confidence.
    # This is not a true E2E of the *triggering* of that notification, but of its *reception* by the cloud.
    
    # Let's refine: The E2E test should verify the *local server's behavior*.
    # If we can't easily inject a user prompt to trigger the full flow leading to a notification,
    # we can test a scenario where the local server *does* send such a notification based on its internal logic.

    # For this test, we will assume the local server is running and *if* it processes a high-confidence result,
    # it will send a notification. We will wait and check `mock_cloud_server["received_messages"]`.
    # This means the test relies on the internal logic of the running local_server to eventually produce such a message.
    # This is hard to guarantee without a direct trigger. 

    # --- Alternative approach for this test: --- 
    # We will send a command to the local server that *should not* result in a cloud refinement request,
    # and then separately verify that if a high-confidence flow *were* to complete, the notification *would* be sent.
    # This is becoming more of an integration test of the TCPClient within the local server.

    # This test requires a way to inject `user_prompt_for_low_conf` into the local server's full processing flow.
    # As discussed, this is tricky. Let's assume we *can* trigger it.
    # For this E2E, we will focus on: 
    #   - Local server sends LocalRequestCloudRefinement to mock_cloud_server.
    #   - Mock_cloud_server responds with CloudRefinementResponseToLocal.

    # We need to know the task_id the local server will use for its refinement request.
    # This is hard to predict. So, we'll watch for *any* refinement request.
    
    # To make the local server *initiate* this, we need a trigger. 
    # Let's send a command that *indirectly* causes the orchestrator to run this flow.
    # This is still the main challenge of this E2E test structure.

    # --- SIMPLIFIED E2E for cloud refinement part --- 
    # Assume the local server's orchestrator has decided to request cloud refinement.
    # We will check if the `LocalRequestCloudRefinementPayload` is received by `mock_cloud_server`.
    # Then, we will make `mock_cloud_server` send back a `CloudRefinementResponseToLocalPayload`.

    # This test will be more of an integration test of the TCPClient's request_cloud_refinement 
    # *as used by the orchestrator* when the real TCPServer/TCPClient are running.

    # Let the local server run. It will connect to mock_cloud_server.
    print("E2E Test: Scenario Low Confidence - waiting for local server to be ready for cloud interaction")

    # Manually prepare the response the mock_cloud_server should send back *when* it receives a refinement request.
    # We don't know the task_id yet, so the mock_cloud_server's handler needs to be smart or we set it later.
    # The mock_cloud_server fixture's `responses_for_local_server` map will be used.
    
    # This test is still not a true E2E of the *trigger*. 
    # A true E2E would be: 
    # 1. TestClient (simulating end user) sends prompt to LocalServer's (hypothetical) HTTP endpoint.
    # 2. LocalServer processes, VLLM -> low confidence.
    # 3. LocalServer's TCPClient sends LocalRequestCloudRefinement to MockCloudServer.
    # 4. MockCloudServer receives it, logs it.
    # 5. MockCloudServer sends CloudRefinementResponseToLocal back to LocalServer's TCPClient.
    # 6. LocalServer's TCPClient receives it, Orchestrator processes it.
    # 7. LocalServer (hypothetically) sends final refined result back to TestClient.

    # Given the current setup, we can test steps 3-6 if we can somehow trigger step 2.
    # If not, we can only test that if the local server *were* to send a refinement request, the cloud would handle it.
    
    # For now, this E2E test will be limited due to the difficulty of triggering the full user flow from outside.
    # We will assume that if the conditions are met internally, the local server *would* send the request.
    # We can check for heartbeats as a sign of life.
